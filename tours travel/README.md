# INTRODUCTION
## About Tourism
The Tours and Travel Management System is a web based application. The main purpose of “Tours and travels management system” is to provide a convenient way for a customer to book hotels, flight, train and bus for the tour purposes. The objective of this project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel agency . In this project, we will make an easier task of searching places and for booking train, flight or bus. In the present system a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places and to book tickets. This often requires a lot of time and effort. We provide approach skills to critically examine how a tourist visits and its ability to operate in an appropriate way when dealing with the consequences of tourism, locally , regionally and nationally including visitor security and ecological influences. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly.
The project “Tours and Travels Management System” is developed to replace the currently existing system, which help in keeping record of customer details of destination as well as payment received. Tourism marketers are faced with a complex environment resulting from unprecedented growth in the tourism industry over the last fifty years. As the phenomenon of tourism has grown, so have the interests of destinations in attracting their share of visitor. Destination choices available to consumers have proliferated.
Today’s tourism marketers must influence consumer decision making in an increasingly complex and competitive global marketplace. Tourism is a complicated setting involving a diverse group of active stakeholders who each have different interests in the tourism market. For destination stakeholders such as Destination Marketing Organisations (DMOs), accommodation providers, and activity operators to survive in an increasingly competitive environment, it is essential that a consistent approach is used by all tourism stakeholders operating within a single destinationThe importance of segmentation in tourism is widely acknowledged .To date research has assisted us to understand which bases can be used by tourism destinations to effectively for a destination using visitor data. Little research attention has been directed towards understanding how the tourism stakeholders segment their markets. As a result we do not know how tourism stakeholders segment a market for managerial and marketing purposes and whether tourism stakeholder segments mirror the segments defined by DMOs. This case study will contribute to the literature by presenting tourism stakeholder views for one tourism destination. It will identify similarities or discrepancies between the segments defined by the DMO and the segments used by tourism stakeholders for managerial and marketing purposes.

# DESIGN AND ANALYSIS
System design is essential to develop model of system before writing any software that is used to control the system or to interact with it during the design process we try to do develop system models at different level of abstraction. Design process invoices data flow diagram and data structure including library functioned in the program. The project developed using the below objects:
## Project Description
This application in develop to provide best travelling services to the customers and travel agents we have developed tours and travel management item to provide a search platform where tourist can find their tour places according to their choices This system also help to promote responsible and interesting tourism so that people can enjoy their holidays at their favorable places system also help to develop tourism with different cultures so that they enrich the tourism experience and build pride We develop this system to create and promote forms of tourism provide healthy interaction opportunities for tourists and locals and increase better understanding different cultures, customs, lifestyles, traditional knowledge and believes. This system also provide a better way to connect with various events This system also gives tours related information like which places de tourist attractions, provinces Tourist can also get the Map and navigation system and temperature and weather information Tourist can also book tours through our tours and travels management system system also keeps a history of visited places of its users.
## System Development Phase
Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) adheres to important phases that are essential for developers, such as planning, analysis, design and implementation, and are explained in the section below. There are several Systems Development Life Cycle Models in existence. The oldest model that was originally regarded as the Systems Development Life Cycle is the waterfall model sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the input for the next These stagesgenerally follow the same basic step but many different waterfall methodologies give the step different names and the number of steps seem to vary between 4 and 7 There is no definitively correct Systems Development Life Cycle model in the stars can be characterized and divided several steps .
Initiation Phase
The Initiation Phase begins when a business or identifies a need or an opportunity. The purpose of the Initiation Phase is to Identity and validate an opportunity to improve business accomplishments of the an n o deficiency related to a business need identify significant assumptions and constraints on solutions t that need Recommend the explosion of alternative concepts and methods to satisfy the need including questioning the need for technology , will change in the business process offer a solution Assure executive business and executive technical sponsorship
## System Concept Development Phase
The System Concept Development Phase begins after business need or opportunity is validated by the Agency/Organization Program Leadership and the Agency/Organization CIO. The purpose of the System Concept Development Phase is to:
Determine the feasibility and appropriateness of the alternatives
Identity system interfaces
Identify basic functional and data requirements to satisfy the business need
Establish system boundaries identity goals, objectives, critical success factors, and performance measures
Evaluate costs and benefits of alternative approaches to satisfy the basic functional requirements
Assess project risks
Identify and initiate risk mitigation actions, and
Develop high-level technical architecture process models, data models and a concept of operations

# Technology Used :
## PHP
PHP is widely used general purpose scripting language that was originally designing for web development to produce dynamic web pages. For this purpose. PHP code is embedded into the HTML source document and interpreted by web server with PHP processor module which generate web page document.
PHP source code compiled on the fly to an internal from that can be executed by the PHP engine in order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the webpage is access , PHP scripts can also deployed in executable format using a PHP compiler.
PHP is one of the most popular server side scripting language running today. It is used for creating dynamic websites that interact with the user all mixed information PHP offers many advantages it is fast, stable, secure, is easy to used and open source (free).
PHP code inserted directly into the HTML that makes up a website When a visitor comes to the website the code is executed Because a PHP is a server side technology, the user does not bed any special browser or plans to see the PHP in action.
Another key advantage of PHP its connective abilities. PHP uses a modular system of extensions to interface with a variety of lines such as graphics, XML ,encryption, etc. In addition, programmers can extend PHP by writing their own extensions and compiling them in the executable or they can create their own executable and load it using PHPs dynamic loading mechanism.
A huge advantage that PHP offers is its community. Since PHP is an A huge advantage that PHP offers is its community. Since PHP is an open source project, the PHP community is willing to share. If you're looking for a particular script chances are another user has already created somethingsimilar Check within the PHP community for availability Likewise, if you have created a function that others might enjoy, be sure to post the code for others.
PHP scripting block always starts with <?php and ends with ?> A PHP scripting block can be placed anywhere in the document
On servers with shorthand support enabled you can start a scripting block with <? and end with ?>.
For maximum compatibility, we recommend that you use the standard form (<?php) rather than the shorthand form.

## MY SQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system(RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter and "SQL, the abbreviation for Structured Query Language The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB now owned by Oracle Corporation For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality.
MySQL was created by a Swedish .company, MySQL added by David Axmark, Allan Larsson and Michael "Monty" Widenius. Original development of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark began in 1994 The first version of MySQL appeared on 23 May 1995. It was initially created for personal usage from SQL based on the low-level language SAM, which the creators considered too slow and inflexible They created a new SQL interface, while keeping the same API as MYSQL
MySQL written in C and C ++ .Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a homebrewedlexical analyzer.
MySQL dump is a logical backup tool included with both community and enterprise editions of MYSQL. It supports backing up from all storage engines. MySQL Enterprise Backup is a hot backup utility included as part of the MySQL Enterprise subscription from Oracle, offering native InnoDB hot backup, as well as backup for other storage engines
Extra Backup is an open-source MYSOL hot backup software program Features include hot, non locking backups for In no DB storage, incremental backups, streaming, parallel-compressed backups, throttling based on the number of UO operations per second, etc.
MySQL Fabric is an integrated system for managing a collection of MySQL servers, and a frame work on top of which high availability and database sharing is built MySQL Fabric is open source, and supports procedure execution in the presence of failure, providing an execution model usually called resilient execution MySQL client libraries are extended so they are hiding the complexities or handling fail over in the event of a server failure, as well as correctly dispatching transactions to the shards.
PhpMyAdmin is a free and open source tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL with the use of a web browser It can perform various tasks such as creating modifying or deleting databases, tables, fields or rows, executing SQL statements, or managing users and permissions. The software, which is available in 78 languages, is maintained by
ThephpMyadminProj

# TABLES USED
1) Admin_reg
2) Book_tour
3) Message
4) Reg
5) Tours

# IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
This phase is initiated after the system has been tested and accepted by the user. In this phase, the system is installed to support the intended business functions. System performance is compared to performance objectives established during the planning phase. Implementation includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto the production computers, and integration of the system onto daily work processes.
This phase continues until the system is operating in production in accordance with the defined user requirements.

# TESTING
Testing is the process of executing then programs with the intention of finding out errors. During the process, the project is executed with set of test and the output of the website is evaluated to determine if the project is performing as expected. Testing makes a logical assumption that if all the parts of the module are correct then goal will be successfully achieved. Testing includes after the completion of the coding phase. The project was tested from the very beginning and also at each step by entering different type of data. In the testing phase some mistakes were found, which did not come to knowledge at the time of coding the project. Then changes were made in the project coding so that it may take all the relevant data and gives the required result. All the forms were tested one by one and made all the required changes. Testing is vital to the success of the system. Testing makes a logical assumption that if all the parts of the system are correct, the goal will be successfully achieved. A small system error can conceivably explode into a much larger problem, Effective testing early in the process translates directly into long-term cost savings from a reduced number of errors. For the verification and validation of data various-nesting task are performed Testing is itself capable of finding the syntactical mistakes in the system but user need to test the system for logical checking.
## LEVELS OF TESTING: 
The aim of the testing process is to identify all the defects in the website. It is not practical to test the website with respect to each value that the input request data may assume. Testing provides a practical way of reducing defects in the website and increasing the user’s confidence in a developed system. Testing consists of subjecting the website to a set of test inputs and observing the program behaves as expected. If the program fails to Testing behave as expected then conditions under which failure occurs are noted for later debugging and correction. The following things are associated with testing. Failure is a manifestation of an error. But the mere presence of an error may not necessarily lead to a failure. A test case is the triplet [I, S, O] where I am data input to the system. S is the state ofthe system at which the data is input, O is the expected output of the system A test suite is the set
of all test cases with which a given software product is to be tested.
## Functional Testing:
Here the system is a black box whose behavior is determined by studying its inputs and related
outputs. The key problem is to select the inputs that have a huge probability of being members of
a set in may case; the selection of these test cases is based on the previous studies.
Structural Testing:
A great deal can be learnt about the strength and the limitation of the application by examine the
manner in which the system breaks. This type of testing has two limitations. It tests failure behavior
of the system circumstances may arise through an unexpected combination of events where the
node placed on the system exceeds the maximum anticipated load. The structure of the each
module was checked at every step.
## Unit Testing:
In unit testing the entire individual functions and modules were tested independently. By following
this strategy all the error in coding were identified and corrected. This method was applied in
combination with the white and black box testing techniques to find the errors in each module.
Unit testing is normally considered an adjunct to the coding step.
Unit test case design was started after source level code had been developed, reviewed, and verified
for correct syntax. A review of design information provides guidance for establishing test cases
that were likely to uncover errors in each of the categories discussed above. Each test case was
coupled with a set of expected results
